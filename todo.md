# Train Graph Viewer — Implementation TODO

This document enumerates the tasks required to implement the Angular application described in README.md. It follows the provided guidelines (standalone components by default, signals for state, strict typing, OnPush change detection, native control flow, etc.).

Recent update (2025-08-27): Implemented GraphCanvasComponent with basic SVG axes and polyline rendering of series from ScheduleService. Integrated into GraphPage. Added vertical grid lines at topology indices when no explicit stop distances are provided, x-axis stop labels (when index-based), y-axis ticks with labels, and axis titles. Ensured Y-axis orientation with time increasing downward. Added numeric X-axis ticks and vertical grid lines when real distances (stop_location) are provided. Added LegendComponent with per-series visibility toggles via SeriesVisibilityService; GraphCanvas now filters series by visibility. Persisted series visibility toggles in localStorage so user choices survive reloads. Added ToolbarComponent with Export SVG, Export PNG, and Export JSON actions. Implemented TimeWindowService with localStorage persistence and wired Y-axis time range selection into GraphCanvas; added Fit/Zoom In/Zoom Out/Reset controls in Toolbar. Implemented nearest-point hover tooltips in GraphCanvas showing time and series, and stop name when using index-based distances. Updated FileDropComponent to display file types (Train line, Topology) alongside file names. Removed 'pasted-' prefix from UI file names (new and hydrated data) and defaulted topology name to 'topology.txt'. Added in-UI file format help with copyable minimal examples and README link in the Load files panel. Added 'Load sample files' button in FileDrop to load public/samples dataset (Local A, Express B, Topology).

## 1. Requirements and Scope
- Clarify units and conventions:
  - Decide base time unit (seconds recommended due to HH:MM:SS support) and distance unit (prefer real distances via `stop_location`; fall back to stop order if not provided). If distances are not provided, use stop order as the distance axis. ✓
  - Confirm input encoding (UTF-8) and line endings. ✓
- Non-goals for v1:
  - No server backend; fully client-side. ✓
  - Persistence is required in-browser (no server): store user data in browser storage so it survives tab/browser restarts. ✓

## 2. Input File Formats
- Train line file (text with YAML frontmatter):
  - Parse frontmatter fields: `name` (string), `default_stop_time` (duration, `HH:MM:SS` or `MM:SS`), `period` (duration, `HH:MM:SS` or `MM:SS`), `runs` (array of start times, `HH:MM:SS` or `HH:MM`), `stop_location` (map stop->distance number, optional), `extra_stop_times` (map stop->duration, `HH:MM:SS` or `MM:SS`). ✓
  - Body contains alternating lines: stop name (string), travel time to next stop (duration, `HH:MM:SS` or `MM:SS`). Last stop has no following travel time. ✓
  - Validation rules:
    - Non-empty name, at least two stops. ✓
    - All travel times non-negative durations. ✓
    - default_stop_time ≥ 0; period > 0. ✓
    - runs times within [00:00:00, 24:00:00) or a consistent arbitrary timeline baseline. ✓
    - extra_stop_times keys must exist among stops; values ≥ 0. ✓
    - If `stop_location` is provided: keys must exist among stops; values are non-negative numbers. If omitted, stops are assumed evenly spaced for distance computations. ✓
  - Time formats:
    - Durations: `HH:MM:SS` or `MM:SS`.
    - Time of day (runs): `HH:MM:SS` or `HH:MM`. ✓
- Topology file (text):
  - One stop name per line; blank lines ignored; comments starting with `#` ignored. ✓
  - Validation:
    - No duplicates. ✓
    - All referenced stops must exist in at least one loaded line. ✓

## 3. Domain Models (TypeScript)
- Types/interfaces (strict types, avoid `any`):
  - `TimeSeconds = number` branded type to avoid unit confusion. ✓
  - `StopId = string`. ✓
  - `TrainLineMeta { name: string; defaultStopTime: TimeSeconds; period: TimeSeconds; runs: TimeOfDay[]; stopLocation?: Record<StopId, number>; extraStopTimes: Record<StopId, TimeSeconds>; }` ✓
  - `TrainLineSpec { meta: TrainLineMeta; segments: { stop: StopId; travelToNext?: TimeSeconds; }[] }` ✓
  - `Topology { stops: StopId[] }` ✓
  - `RunInstance { lineName: string; runStart: number; schedule: StopSchedulePoint[] }` ✓
  - `StopSchedulePoint { stop: StopId; arrival: number; departure: number }` ✓
  - `GraphSeries { id: string; color: string; points: { distance: number; time: number }[] }` ✓
  - `ParseError { file: string; line?: number; message: string }` ✓
  - Utility types: `Result<T, E>` to capture parsing/validation outcomes. ✓

## 4. Parsing and Validation
- Implement a pure parser for train line files:
  - Split frontmatter (YAML) and body; use a minimal YAML parser; normalize keys. ✓ (src/domain/train-line.ts: parseTrainLine)
  - Parse times:
    - Durations: accept `HH:MM:SS` and `MM:SS`; convert to seconds. ✓ (src/domain/time.ts: parseDuration)
    - Time of day (runs): accept `HH:MM:SS` and `HH:MM`; convert to seconds since baseline. ✓ (src/domain/time.ts: parseTimeOfDay)
  - Build `TrainLineSpec`; collect `ParseError[]` on issues. ✓ (src/domain/train-line.ts)
- Implement topology parser (line-by-line). ✓ (src/domain/topology.ts)
- Add cross-file validation:
  - Topology stops must be subset of union of stops across all lines. ✓ (validated in FileParserService.crossFileErrors)
  - Warn (non-fatal) for unused extra_stop_times keys. ✓
    - Implemented as warnings when extra_stop_times entries are zero seconds (redundant, no effect). Exposed via FileParserService.extraStopTimesWarnings and included in allErrors list. ✓

## 5. Scheduling Engine (Pure Functions)
- For each `TrainLineSpec` and each `run`:
  - Compute arrival/departure times per stop:
    - Start at `runStart` seconds from baseline (e.g., midnight). ✓
    - At each stop: arrival = previous departure + travel time; departure = arrival + defaultStopTime + extraStopTimes[stop] (if any). ✓
  - Enforce `period` rule: if the run finishes early, append idle at last stop until `runStart + period`. ✓
- Edge cases:
  - Zero travel time segments. ✓
  - Empty extra_stop_times. ✓
  - Overlapping runs (allowed). ✓
  - Large periods; wrap across midnight not required if using absolute seconds timeline. ✓
- Output `RunInstance` and derive `GraphSeries` points filtered by topology stops. ✓

## 6. Graph Computation and Rendering
- Axis definitions:
  - X-axis: distance. Use `stop_location` distance when provided; otherwise use evenly spaced indices based on topology order. ✓
  - Y-axis: time (seconds). ✓
- Series generation:
  - For each run, create polyline segments connecting (distance, time) for each visited stop that exists in topology. ✓
  - If a line has stops not in topology, skip those points. ✓
- Rendering:
  - Choose rendering approach: SVG for clarity/scalability; Canvas optional later for very large datasets. ✓
  - Implement pan/zoom (optional v1: vertical scroll, time window selection). ✓ (basic time window selection via toolbar buttons)
  - Draw station grid lines at topology indices when no explicit stop distances are provided and label axes (x: stop names when index-based, y: time ticks). ✓
  - When real distances are provided (stop_location), show numeric X-axis ticks with vertical grid lines and formatted labels. ✓
  - Color-code lines/runs; legend. ✓

## 7. Angular Application Architecture
- Routing (lazy-loaded feature):
  - `routes: [{ path: '', loadComponent: () => import('./app/graph-page/graph-page.component') }]` ✓
- Services (providedIn: 'root') using `inject()`:
  - `FileParserService` for parsing line/topology files. ✓ (src/app/services/file-parser.service.ts)
    - Use domain parsers: parseTrainLine (src/domain/train-line.ts) and parseTopology (src/domain/topology.ts). ✓
    - Return signals or Results with aggregated ParseError[] per file. ✓
  - `ScheduleService` for computing schedules and series. ✓
  - `ColorService` to assign colors per line/run. ✓
- State management (signals):
  - Signals for: loaded train lines, topology, validation errors, derived graph series, selected time window. ✓
  - Use `computed()` for derived series from raw inputs. ✓
  - Never use `mutate`; use `set`/`update`. ✓
- Components (standalone, OnPush, small responsibilities, inline templates where small):
  - `GraphPageComponent`: orchestrates inputs and displays graph and side panels. ✓
  - `FileDropComponent`: file picker/drag-drop for uploading multiple train line files and one topology file. ✓
    - Implement file picker (multiple train lines + single topology) and wire to FileParserService. ✓
    - Display selected file names. ✓
    - Drag-and-drop area. ✓
    - Pasting raw text into textareas. ✓
  - `ErrorListComponent`: shows parsing/validation errors. ✓ (implemented and integrated into GraphPage)
  - `GraphCanvasComponent` (SVG): renders axis, grid, and series. ✓ (basic axes + series rendering; grid lines for topology indices when no distances)
  - `LegendComponent`: color legend and toggles per line/run. ✓ (added LegendComponent and SeriesVisibilityService; GraphCanvas filters series by visibility)
  - `ToolbarComponent`: controls (zoom, time range, export).
    - Export actions (SVG, JSON). ✓
    - Zoom controls. ✓
    - Time range selection. ✓
- Host bindings via `host` in decorators (avoid HostBinding/HostListener). ✓
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for static images if any (logos), avoiding base64 inline. ✓
  - Not applicable in v1: no static images are used in the app.
- Templates:
  - Use `@if`, `@for`, `@switch`; avoid structural directives equivalents. ✓
  - Avoid `ngClass`/`ngStyle`; prefer property/class/style bindings. ✓
- Change detection:
  - Ensure all components (including App and GraphPageComponent) use OnPush. ✓

## 8. UI/UX and Accessibility
- File input & editing UX:
  - Support multiple file selection, drag-and-drop, and pasting raw text into textareas. ✓
  - After upload or paste, display file contents in editable textareas; re-parse automatically on changes and update the graph live. ✓
  - Show file names and types; validate on load and on each edit; show errors with file/line context. ✓
  - Provide in-UI documentation and examples of the required file formats (Train line with YAML frontmatter and Topology), including minimal and full examples; link to README for details. ✓
  - Remove the "pasted" prefix for manually created/pasted files in the UI; display the user-provided or default name without any prefix. ✓
  - Resize/reflow the File UI (editor and messages) so files and the graph are visible simultaneously without scrolling (e.g., side-by-side layout or resizable panes). ✓
    - Implemented a two-pane split layout in GraphPage with a draggable, keyboard-accessible vertical resizer. Left pane contains Help/Load files, Messages, and Legend; right pane contains Toolbar and Graph. Pane width persists in localStorage and is constrained between 240px and 70% of viewport. Mobile (<=800px) stacks vertically and hides the resizer.
    - Follow-up: support touch/pointer-based resizing for mobile/tablets (pointer events). ✓
    - Follow-up: double-click separator to reset to default width. ✓
- Graph UX:
  - Tooltips on hover showing stop, time, line/run name. ✓
    - Implemented nearest-point tooltip in GraphCanvas with stop name when using index-based distances; for real distances, tooltip shows time and series id. Persisting nothing; purely UI. ✓
  - Keyboard navigation for panning/zooming; focus management. ✓
    - Implemented keyboard controls on GraphCanvas: focusable host (tabindex=0), aria-keyshortcuts, and keydown handler using host bindings (no HostListener). '+'/'=' zoom in, '-' zoom out, ArrowUp/ArrowDown and PageUp/PageDown pan time window (Shift for larger steps). ✓
  - High-contrast color palette; ARIA roles/labels for interactive elements. ✓
    - Increased contrast for buttons, links, borders, and text in Toolbar, FileDrop, Legend; added strong :focus-visible outlines and :focus-within styles for keyboard users.
    - Added ARIA roles and keyboard support to the split resizer (role=separator, aria-orientation=vertical, tabindex=0, ArrowLeft/ArrowRight to resize).
    - Follow-up: run automated a11y checks (axe) across main views and verify WCAG AA for color contrast in all states (hover/active/disabled).
  - Y-axis orientation: ensure time increases going down (invert axis rendering and tick mapping accordingly). Note that in SVG, the coordinates grow going down on the screen. ✓
- Loading/export:
  - Allow exporting current graph as SVG/PNG; export parsed data as JSON for debugging. ✓
    - Export SVG. ✓
    - Export JSON (series). ✓
    - Export PNG. ✓

## 9. Performance and Robustness
- Efficient parsing (chunked for big files if needed). ✓/□
- Memoize computed series via `computed()` signals. ✓/□
- Virtualization for long legends or error lists. ✓/□
- Graceful handling of thousands of runs/points; consider downsampling for view. ✓/□

## 10. Persistence
- Required in-browser persistence (no server):
  - Persist all user data locally so it's available after closing/reopening the browser: uploaded files and edited textarea contents. ✓
    - Implemented via localStorage hydration/persist in FileDropComponent (key: train-graph-viewer:v1). ✓
  - Prefer IndexedDB for larger text blobs; fallback to localStorage if simplicity is acceptable for v1. ✓/□
    - v1 uses localStorage with try/catch; follow-up to migrate to IndexedDB for large files/quota resilience. □
  - Also persist UI state (last selected time window, toggles, graph options). ✓ (series visibility toggles exist; time window persisted under key train-graph-viewer:v1:time-window)

## 11. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests:
  - Parsers (valid and invalid cases). ✓/□
  - Scheduling engine (edge cases: zero times, extra stop times, period wait). ✓/□
  - Graph series generation mapping to topology indices. ✓/□
- Component tests:
  - Signal-driven derivations and rendering conditions. ✓/□
- E2E tests:
  - Load sample files -> see lines on graph; errors visible for malformed files. ✓/□

## 12. Tooling and Configuration
- Enable strict TypeScript options (no implicit any, strict null checks). ✓ (tsconfig.json strict settings already enabled)
- ESLint/Prettier configuration aligned with Angular and signals. ✓/□
- NPM scripts for build, serve, test, e2e, lint. ✓/□

## 13. Sample Data and Docs
- Create sample train line files (2+ lines) and a sample topology file for testing/demos. ✓
  - Added public/samples/local-a.train (with stop_location and extra_stop_times). ✓
  - Added public/samples/express-b.train (index-based distances). ✓
  - Added public/samples/topology.txt (Central, East Side, Meadow, Hilltop). ✓
  - Follow-up: Add UI links/buttons to quickly load sample files from public/samples. ✓
- Update README with usage instructions and file format examples. ✓/□

## 14. Delivery Checklist
- All tasks above marked ✓.
- App builds and serves; basic flows work.
- No console errors; a11y checks pass (axe or similar).
- Code adheres to provided guidelines (standalone components, signals, OnPush, no HostBinding/HostListener decorators, etc.).
